It also supports string filtering on dates and numberic fields in linq to entities without retrieving the entire list. The project was created in visual studio 2012 and requires .net framework 4.5 to be installed.\r\n\r\njQuery Datatables\r\n========================\r\n\r\nThe jQuery Datatables plugin is a very powerful javascript grid plugin which comes with the following features out of the box:\r\n\r\n* filtering\r\n* sorting\r\n* paging\r\n* jqQuery ui themeroller support\r\n* plugins  \r\n* Ajax/Remote and local datasource support\r\n\r\nUsing the Parser\r\n========================\r\n\r\nPlease see the [official datatables documentation](http://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/data_sources/server_side.html) for examples on setting it up to connect to a serverside datasource.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample asp.net mvc action which uses the parser\r\n\r\n            public JsonResult DocumentList()\r\n            {\r\n            \tvar context = new DocumentsEntities(); //Entity framework context\r\n                IQueriable<Document> documents = context.Documents.where(d => d.IsActive);\r\n\r\n            \tvar parser = new DataTablesParser<Document>(Request, documents);\r\n            \treturn Json(parser.Parse());\r\n             }\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nContributions, comments, changes, issues\r\n========================\r\n\r\nI welcome any suggestions for improvement, contributions, questions or issues with using this code. \r\nIt is the result of continuous changes to deal with issues encountered while using it so I am sure there are some things that can be \r\noptimized or removed altogether. One of the biggest things this has forced me to deal with is the differences between LINQ to entites and LINQ to Objects.\r\n\r\nContact \r\n========================\r\nTwitter: [garvincasimir](https://twitter.com/garvincasimir)\r\nGoogle+: [garvincasimir](https://plus.google.com/100137710586918559017)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
