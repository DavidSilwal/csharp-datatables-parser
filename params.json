It also supports string filtering on dates and numberic fields in linq to entities without retrieving the entire list. The project was created in visual studio 2012 and requires .net framework 4.5 to be installed.\r\n\r\nThis project is provided under the MIT License.\r\n\r\njQuery Datatables\r\n========================\r\n\r\nThe jQuery Datatables plugin is a very powerful javascript grid plugin which comes with the following features out of the box:\r\n\r\n* filtering\r\n* sorting\r\n* paging\r\n* jqQuery ui themeroller support\r\n* plugins  \r\n* Ajax/Remote and local datasource support\r\n\r\nUsing the Parser\r\n========================\r\n\r\nPlease see the [official datatables documentation](http://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/data_sources/server_side.html) for examples on setting it up to connect to a serverside datasource.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample asp.net mvc action which uses the parser\r\n\r\n            public JsonResult DocumentList()\r\n            {\r\n            \tvar context = new DocumentsEntities(); //Entity framework context\r\n                IQueriable<Document> documents = context.Documents.where(d => d.IsActive);\r\n\r\n            \tvar parser = new DataTablesParser<Document>(Request, documents);\r\n            \treturn Json(parser.Parse());\r\n             }\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n========================\r\n \r\n The easiest way to get this library into your project is through NuGet. You can search using the NuGet package manager, or you\r\n can enter the following command in your package manager console:\r\n \r\n            PM> Install-Package DataTablesParser              \r\n\r\nContributions, comments, changes, issues\r\n========================\r\n\r\nI welcome any suggestions for improvement, contributions, questions or issues with using this code. \r\nIt is the result of continuous changes to deal with issues encountered while using it so I am sure there are some things that can be \r\noptimized or removed altogether. One of the biggest things this has forced me to deal with is the differences between LINQ to entites and LINQ to Objects.\r\n\r\n* Please do not include multiple unrelated fixes in a single pull request\r\n* The diff for your pull request should only show changes related to your fix/addition (Some editors create unnecessary changes).\r\n* When possible include tests that cover the features/changes in your pull request\r\n* Before you submit make sure the existing tests pass with your changes\r\n* Linq to Entities tests which include search parameters will fail because I use Sql Server CE (Will fix that).\r\n\r\nContact \r\n========================\r\nTwitter: [garvincasimir](https://twitter.com/garvincasimir)\r\nGoogle+: [garvincasimir](https://plus.google.com/100137710586918559017)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
